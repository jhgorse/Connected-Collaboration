Items marked with a ★ are high priority

* Network communication
 ★ Timeout quickly on unimportant messages
 ★ Handle timeouts during calls due to disappearing peers
 ★ Pause/resume calls correctly
 - Retry sending of important messages

* Asynchronous
 - All API is currently synchronous; add async when working on GUI once more of
   the interactions have been mapped out and coded
 - Network communication is blocking and synchronous internally. Some of that
   should be asynchronous (it's all run in a separate thread so not a big issue
   right now)
 ★ For example, replies to incoming queries should definitely be asynchronous.

* Error handling
 - We need to define our own GErrors and pass them around in the API. Currently,
   we just pass around NULL. The machinery is in place, so should be
   straighforward. Because we don't do this, we don't check the set GError at
   all and leak GErrors.
 - Need ERROR types in the network protocol itself so the negotiator and/or
   peers can take appropriate corrective action instead of just aborting the
   negotiation process or the call.

* Logging
 - Right now, we log very verbosely to GST_DEBUG for convenience in debugging.
   Change this so we do relatively expensive logging (such as logging that needs
   variant printing) conditional on the log level and do it at the GST_TRACE log
   level (or similar).

* Video format negotiation
 - We pass-through whatever highest-quality format the Webcam outputs to the
   peers. That can be JPEG or H.264. This makes sense and should not be changed.
 - Raw video caps are useless and will not be added. USB 2 webcams (99% of all
   consumer webcams) cannot output HD video at 30fps in any raw video format.
   They output either JPEG or H.264. The exceptions are cards like Decklink.
 - It probably makes sense to transparently add a jpegenc element in case we
   encounter a webcam that only outputs low quality YUV raw video.
 - Evaluate whether it's worth it to add H.264 support. The highest quality
   might be given by JPEG, in which case H.264 would be useless. Need to do
   bitrate and quality comparisons and find out whether it's feasible to have an
   element that only converts H.264-encoded video outputted by a webcam to
   keyframe-only H.264 video.
 - Note that we're using keyframe-based video formats to reduce startup latency
   while avoiding complexity in the peers.
 - Choose send/recv caps based on available CPU/network bandwidth

* General
 - Add the ability for any peer to add other peers to an existing call
 - Allow peers to gracefully degrade a call; reducing video res or removing it
   altogether
   + New msg type: CHANGE_CALL_DETAILS
   + Some types of format changes don't even need an out of band renegotiation;
     such as changing the resolution of the outputted JPEG
   + TODO: Only set generic caps without resolution for video and let the
     depayloader detect it at runtime. This works for JPEG, not sure about H.264
 - Add signals (move from structs to GObjects for OneVideo*Peer objects?) for
   things like negotiation-done, remote-added, remote-removed, call-ended, etc.
   
* Device probing/monitoring
 - GstDeviceMonitor API does not have a way to query whether a device is under
   use. Currently, we try to use the device and fail, but we should fix the API.
